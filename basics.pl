1.Scalar

Scalars are simple variables. 
They are preceded by a dollar sign ($). 
A scalar is either a number, a string, or a reference. 
A reference is actually an address of a variable, which we will see in the upcoming chapters.

2.Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists of scalars that you access with a numeric index, which starts with 0. 
They are preceded by an "at" sign (@).

3.Hashes

Hashes are unordered sets of key/value pairs that you access using the keys as subscripts. 
They are preceded by a percent sign (%).
